		<h3>Risky Roads</h3>
		<p>This was a team project that I worked on with Macarena Peralta  (<a href="mailto: peraltam@umich.edu">peraltam@umich.edu</a>), Andy Yang  (<a href="mailto: andyyhy@umich.edu">andyyhy@umich.edu</a>), 
        Angela Peng  (<a href="mailto: penga@umich.edu">penga@umich.edu</a>), and Nicholas Stackhouse (<a href="mailto: nstack@umich.edu">nstack@umich.edu</a>) worked on together for our class, EECS 498.
		<br>
		<br>
		This was an open ended project, meaning that our team had the creative freedom to choose a project to work on for 5 weeks and then showcase to the public. Thus, our team discussed many possible ideas which 
        landed us at Risky Roads. RiskyRoads is an educational program designed to enhance driver's education by using immersive simulations to demonstrate the dangers of hazardous driving behaviors like distracted 
        driving or driving under the influence. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our main focus was to educate users through interactive scenarios, highlighting the difficulty and potential consequences of such behaviors to discourage them from being replicated 
        in real life. The program targets a wide audience, including driver education schools and individual learners, offering flexible pricing to make it accessible for both personal and enterprise use.
		<br>
		<br>
		The manner in which we managed this project was through the Jira Software which allowed us to plan out every task required for the project, assigning tasks to each other, and communicating through the progress displayed on the site. Overall, this was a big challenge as a first attempt at a larger scale AR project using new softwares and tools listed below. We both definitly enjoyed seeing our vision for the studio come to fruition, and are happy with its turnout. Hopefully you like it too!

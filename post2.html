		<h3>A2 GO! AR Tree Game</h3>
		<p>This was a project that myself and Macarena Peralta (<a href="mailto: peraltam@umich.edu">peraltam@umich.edu</a>) worked on together for our class, EECS 498, where the focus was understanding basics of building a simple AR game from scratch. This game is models after the Pokemon Go game, where the user is able to interact with their real world environment to plant trees and build up currency.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some of the checkpoints we went through was building out a simple UI for the clickable elements of the app, importing models such as trees, squirrels, and sprites, and adding interaction to these models such as squirrel movement or tree growth.
		<br>
		<br>
		The final challenge of the project was to add our own custom object. Maca and I decided on adding a learn more button for the landmarks which give you more information on that specific landmark.
		<br>
		<br>
		The manner in which we managed this project was through the Jira Software which allowed us to plan out every task required for the project, assigning tasks to each other, and communicating through the progress displayed on the site. Overall, this was a big challenge as a first attempt at a larger scale AR project using new softwares and tools listed below. We both definitly enjoyed seeing our vision for the studio come to fruition, and are happy with its turnout. Hopefully you like it too!

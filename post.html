		<h3>CSE Virtual Reality Studio Simulation</h3>
		<p>This was a project that myself and Macarena Peralta (<a href="mailto: peraltam@umich.edu">peraltam@umich.edu</a>) worked on together for our class, EECS 498, where the focus was understanding basics of building a simple VR simulation from scratch. The simulation models a study location on the Univeristy of Michigan North Campus known as the Bob and Beyster Building room 1670. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Some of the checkpoints we went through was blocking out the strucutre of the studio, importing meshes to model elements of the studio such as computers, trash bins, whiteboards, and other office objects, and adding interaction to all of the models we imported to simulate how the studio would function in the real world.
		<br>
		<br>
		The final challenge of the project was to add our own custom object. Maca and I decided on adding a record player with vinyls in the back of the room to encompass how music helps us study and get through the majority of our daily tasks.
		<br>
		<br>
		The manner in which we managed this project was through the Jira Software which allowed us to plan out every task required for the project, assigning tasks to each other, and communicating through the progress displayed on the site. Overall, this was a good challenge for it being our first attempt at a larger scale VR project using new softwares and tools listed below. We both definitly enjoyed seeing our vision for the studio come to fruition, and are happy with its turnout. Hopefully you like it too!

		<h5>Technologies and Tools:</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>- Unreal Engine 5</li>
			<li>- Blueprint Visual Scripting</li>
			<li>- Jira Software</li>
			<li>- Sketchfab</li>
			<li>- Github Desktop</li>
			<li>- Freesound</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<h5>Checkpoint Videos:</h5>
		<p>Check out some of the videos we took that capture the progress of this project. Moving left to right, the first video shows the basic structure of the studio with some small interactions and models imported, the second then shows a more complete studio with majority of our interactions comlete, and the last one demonstrates the completed project.</p>
